## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Setup]: Pure JS crypto via @noble/curves — @solana/web3.js breaks in edge runtimes
- [Setup]: Monorepo structure — allows independent versioning of adapters
- [Setup]: Zod as optional peer dep — service definitions need validation but core should not require it
- [Setup]: Subpath exports (@heylol/sdk/services) — tree-shaking, progressive disclosure

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2]: x402 facilitator payload format is LOW confidence — must validate against real API before implementing src/auth/x402.ts
- [Phase 2]: Zero-amount dummy transaction blockhash convention is LOW confidence — requires integration test against real API
- [Phase 6]: Miniflare v4 API may have changed since training cutoff (Aug 2025) — verify before Cloudflare adapter work
